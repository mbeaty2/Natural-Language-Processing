# Natural-Language-Processing

This repository contains my final NLP Project. For this project, I have used topic modelling and trained a LSTM classification model on "True" and "Fake" news datasets. 

Within this repository you will find the following:

1. Combined_News_Dataset is the saved dataset created from the original separated datasets found on Kaggle, saved as a .csv and uploaded as a zipped file. 

The original datasets can be viewed here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset. 

2. A jupyter notebook with all code. 

3. Both .json files are the saved model and weights from my classification system. 

4. Natural Language Processing Critical Essay is the final copy of my research report.
